CUP A SOUP HOT AND SPICY SOUP TOM YUM 50 GR \u003Cbr\/\u003E At Continental we partner with our Australian farmers to grow all of the wheat used in the flour for our noodles sustainably - growing our sustainable wheat in a way which minimises water and fertiliser use, protecting the biodiversity of the land and reducing energy consumption and waste. It\u0027s not only good for the planet but tastes great! Continental has been a part of Australian homes since the 1950s, when we first launched our iconic Chicken Noodle Soup. Since then, we have been consistently delivering Australians the soups they know and love. Our Continental products are made with carefully selected ingredients. All of our vegetables, herbs and spices are grown in the field, ripened in the sun, and harvested in season \u00e2?? when they taste their best. Next, these ingredients are dried, which is the oldest known way of preserving food. At Continental, we\u00e2??ve always prided ourselves on the quality of what we produce, from sourcing the best quality ingredients to putting passionate and talented chefs in our kitchens. Now we\u00e2??re bringing this same passion for quality to our quest for sustainability, because food grown responsibly simply tastes better.\u00c2\u00a0\u003Cbr\/\u003E Made in our Australian factory \u003Cbr\/\u003E Free from artificial colours, flavours \u0026 added MSG. \u003Cbr\/\u003E Made with flour from 100% Sustainably Grown Australian Wheat. \u003Cbr\/\u003E 3.5 Health Star Rating \u003Cbr\/\u003E Just add boiling water \u003Cbr\/\u003E Flavour to feel good about\u003C\/p\u003E","has_nutrition":1,"slug":"continental-cup-a-soup-spicy-tom-yum","s3_uploaded":0,"cdnUrl":null,"discountDiff":-1},{"id":"38114","original_url":"https:\/\/www.woolworths.com.au\/shop\/productdetails\/751442\/go-natural-fruit-snacks-frugos-berry","brand":null,"categoryId":1,"fromSite":"woolworth","fullName":"Go Natural Fruit Snacks Frugos Berry","imgUrl":"https:\/\/cdn0.woolworths.media\/content\/wowproductimages\/large\/751442.jpg","lastInsertPriceTime":"2019-09-30T18:18:53","latestPrice":2.79,"beforePrice":0,"changePercent":0,"name":"Go Natural Fruit Snacks Frugos Berry","crawledTime":"2017-04-28T11:52:08","normalPrice":3.6,"discount":33,"lastUpdateNormalPrice":"2019-09-30T18:46:46","lastChangedPriceTime":"2019-09-30T18:18:53","unit":"150g","priceDifferentWithNormal":-0.81,"caloriesPerServing":null,"caloriesPer100":null,"description":"\u003Cp\u003EAll natural fruity centres smothered in tangy creamy yoghurt. \u003Cbr\/\u003E Delicious fruity centres smothered in a creamy tangy yoghurt coating.
